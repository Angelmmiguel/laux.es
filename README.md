# laux.es

This repo includes a blog I used to write called laux.es. I won't write any new article in this blog. I'll do in other blog I'm working :).

I want to keep all the articles because I still have some visits and I think the content of the posts is useful! Also, the blog is in spanish so I'll translate some of them to English.

To download the Ghost blog, I've just used `wget`. I needed to change some link refences, but it was really easy.

```
wget --mirror -p --html-extension --convert-links https://laux.es
```
